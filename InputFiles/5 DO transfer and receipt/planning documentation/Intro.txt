"Script #5 Test Automation:   DO Transfer and Receipt (06B to 06Y Stock Custom Bag DO Transfers - Wave, Pick, Pack, Ship, Receive, Putaway)    Total Work Est 8 Days

Task #1:  Pick, Pack, Ship DOs from WM  (4 Days)
Task #2:  Receive, Putaway DOs  (2 Days)
Task #3:  Testing and Documentation (2 Days)

The process of transferring bags between 06B and 06Y is extremely labor intensive since each bag is an individual LPN and the transfer must be done at the LPN Level out of WM.    This automated script should help to move material between the warehouses faster and should reduce the Acushnet Resource requirements during testing cycles for Gear."

Task 1: Read DO numbers from excel spreadsheet
Task 2: Process each individual DO number through the MW portion of the process
Task 3: Process each individual DO number through the AGS portion of the process
Task 4: Test and document
