"#10 custom headwear order entry" script is only order entry for the part number in the excel file and the associated simple configurations. These configurations must be data-driven. That is to say that the configuration options are selected based on the text input of the data file and not hard-coded like it has been in the past.

Attached is the custom headwear script file which is built slightly different from the bag & accessory file where it is built with the most basic personalization on one order and one logo on the other order.  

Building the one logo script is the priority for order entry only at this time.
